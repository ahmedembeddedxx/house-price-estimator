## Dataset

The dataset for this project is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedembedded/pakistan-houses-pricing-data-web-scrapped). It contains essential information about houses, including square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more. Cleaning and preprocessing of the data have been performed to ensure its suitability for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: The dataset was sourced from [Zameen](zameen.com). Cleaning and preprocessing were performed to enhance data quality.

2. **Data Exploration**: An in-depth analysis of the dataset was conducted to gain insights into data distribution, correlations, and potential patterns.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Relevant features were selected and engineered to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.

4. **Model Building**: Machine learning algorithms were implemented to build an accurate house pricing prediction model.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance was assessed using various evaluation metrics and cross-validation techniques.

6. **Deployment**: The model has been deployed as a user-friendly web application, allowing end-users to predict house prices conveniently.
